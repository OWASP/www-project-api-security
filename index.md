<p>While working as developers or information security consultants, many people have encountered APIs as part of a project. While there are some resources to help create and evaluate these projects (such as the OWASP REST Security Cheat Sheet), there has not be a comprehensive security project designed to assist builders, breakers, and defenders in the community.</p>

<p>The OWASP API Security Project seeks to deliver actionable documentation on creating and deploying verifiably secure web APIs, as well as illustrating the major risks and shortfalls that APIs may encounter. By helping developers create resilient software, and helping assessors understand the subtle risks an API may entail, the goal of this project is to bring security to an increasingly programmatic world.</p>
<p>The primary deliverables of this project are the <strong>OWASP Top Ten API Security Risks</strong> and a secure API development <strong>documentation portal.</strong></p>

# FAQ

## How can I participate in your project?

This project welcomes contributors of all sorts. The easiest way to get
involved is to contact the Project Leader, and indicate that you're
willing to help.

## What type of contributors are you seeking?

We're currently looking for software developers who have experience
building out resilient APIs, and security assessors who have assessed
APIs. This project is currently in the "research" stage, meaning that
the more you can contribute to building out the project, the better\!

## Can I still participate if I'm not a developer/assessor?

Sure -- we just need to figure out the correct role. If you're strong
with technical writing, that would be great; if there are other skill
sets you think you can bring to the table, please let us know.

# Acknowledgements

## Contributors

The OWASP API Security Project is small, but will be maintained by
volunteers. If you'd like to volunteer, please contact the Project
Leader.
